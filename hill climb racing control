# 🎮 Hill Climb Racing with Hand Gesture Control

Control the Hill Climb Racing game using hand gestures with the help of OpenCV and MediaPipe.
This project demonstrates how computer vision and gesture recognition can be used to interact with games in real-time, without a keyboard or mouse.

✨ Features

🎥 Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe

🖐️ Custom gesture recognition for game controls (e.g., accelerate, brake, tilt)

🎮 Seamless integration with the Hill Climb Racing game

🚀 Touchless and fun gaming experience
